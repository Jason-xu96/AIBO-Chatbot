This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The UI design drew inspiration from: https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*IorQ7yhO19UaBx61L2peMA.png

I refered it as a general guideline. Since my application is a chatbot not a message app, I removed the left contact list and login feature. 

The styling has been drastically changed from the original style.

Please make sure you have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 before running the app.

Open Node.js, navigate to the aibo-chatbot directory, then you can run:

npm start

If the browser doesn't pop up, please open http://localhost:3000 in your prefered browser.

After starting the app, type your question one at a time in the input box and press ‘enter’.
